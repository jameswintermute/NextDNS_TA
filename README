## About
- This TA is written for use within Splunk v8.x, 9.x
- It is intended to be used with the DNS privacy and security tool [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) and the App which I have also published on Splunkbase
- Beta release: this is far from perfect but as a colleague used to tell me, 'Don't let perfect be the enemy of good'.
- I publish this as an individual within the cyber security community, it is not an official reslease from the vendor.
- There is a challenge with duplicate events, the vendor logs do not offer a means for UID tracking, I am working on this.

## Splunkbase:
- Listed as of 2023-09-27, see: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/apps?keyword=NextDNS

## Setup
- This is the 'TA' which should be installed on your UF, HF, IDX.
- There is a APP which should be deployed to your SH that has useful dashboards and searches.

## Manual CURL pull from NextDNS
- The intention is that this step is automated on your UF, but here is the manual pull:
- Log into your NextDNS account
- Obtain your ID
- Navigate to your account page: https://my.nextdns.io/account
- Obtain your API key
- Replace the <value> placeholders with the Key and ID values 

<pre>
   curl -X GET -H "X-Api-Key: <API key>" -s -L https://api.nextdns.io/profiles/<ID>/logs/download > nextdns.log
</pre>
